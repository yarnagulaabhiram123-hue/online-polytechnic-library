<p>📌 4. Downloading Notes & Using Counters

To download:

* Find the resource you want.
* Click the **Download Button**.
* The file will open in a new tab or directly download (depending on your browser).

<p> 📌 5. Rating Study Materials

Ratings are very important to maintain **quality** in AR Libraries. To rate a resource:

1. Find the note you used.
2. Click the **Rate Button** (★).
3. Each click adds to the rating score.

⭐ The higher the rating, the more trusted the resource becomes. This helps new users choose the best notes quickly.

<p>📌 6. Common Problems & Solutions (FAQs)

**Q1: My uploaded note is not showing. What should I do?**
👉 Refresh the page. Sometimes the local storage may take a moment to update.

**Q2: I uploaded the wrong file link. Can I edit it?**
👉 Currently, you cannot edit directly. But you can delete and re-upload the correct version.

👉 Make sure you click the **Download Button**. Simply opening a file link without using the button may not update the counter.

**Q4: Can I upload large files?**
👉 Yes, but since the system uses links (Google Drive, Dropbox), upload the file there and share the link instead of directly uploading large files.

**Q5: Do I need an account to use AR Libraries?**
👉 For the current version, **no account is required**. You can freely upload, search, and download. Future versions may include profiles for better tracking.
